## What makes this different?

Most "Awesome AI" lists are link dumps. AI-Pulse is a **structured registry**:

- 📋 **JSON schema** — every entry has consistent fields (pricing, maturity, curator note)
- 🤖 **Weekly auto-updates** — GitHub Actions + AI scraper finds new tools every Monday
- 🗺️ **Role-based learning paths** — not just links, but curated journeys
- 💬 **Curator notes** — a human insight on *why* each entry matters
- ✅ **Human reviewed** — all entries pass a quality gate before merging
